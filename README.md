# Bamazon

## Overview

Bamazon is a CLI app that simulates an online storefront similar to Amazon's (a very reduced version of Amazon). 

There are three different levels of access for this storefront.

## Customer

	As a customer you will be able to view a list of products and make a choice on which product you want to buy and how much of that product you would like to buy. At the end you will be given a total for you choices you made. If the product is out of stock, Bamazon will tell you how much is left, if any, and you will be given the chance to order something else, enter a new quantity, or cancel altogther.

## Manager

Manager mode allows you to:
#### View Products For Sale
	Simply view all products available for sale
#### View Low Inventory
	Run a check to see if there's any product with a quantity less than 5
#### Add To Inventory
	You can change the available quantity of an item
#### Add New Product
	Add a completely new product to the lineup

## Supervisor
	Supervisor access allows you to view the profitability of each department when you choose `View Product Sales By Department`. 
	Here you will be able to see the product sales, overhead costs, and total profit for each department.
	Additionally, you will have the access to add another department by select the `Create Department` option.
